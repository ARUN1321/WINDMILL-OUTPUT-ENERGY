# WINDMILL-OUTPUT-ENERGY
The file I have submitted will run in jupyter. """"" in the code you must paste data 
file location and run it. the place where to paste the location will be shown in the code using this symbol(@)
When you run this code it will ask a question about prediction wheather in hours or in minutes or in days. 
If you select hours you must give inputs in a single integer not in points like (1.30 and etc...) input for hours must be like 5 or 7 and above. 
if ypu select in minutes the input must be in tens like 10,20,30 and etc.. it can be in hundreds and thousands but if the input is like 22,65, etc.. 
it will not calculate because each data i recieved has readings for 10minutes so the input for minutes must be in tens, hundreds, 
thousands and etc.. not like 22, 65, 35.if you select days it must be in integers like 5, 6, 8 and etc...
